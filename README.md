## Overview
This repository contains a variety of scripting and "processing" problems implemented in bash, perl, C or even a bit of Java using threads. It is focused on demonstrating skills in different aspects of operating systems understanding, ~low level programming.

## Exercises:

### Bash - multi-purpose scripts.
### Perl - scipt for filling html page (creating table) with some data.
### C problems with variety of main concepts:
